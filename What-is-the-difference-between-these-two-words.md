# What is the difference between these two words?

 - Look up the words up in a J-E [dictionary](https://jisho.org)
 - Look up the definitions for both words in a [J-J dictionary](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp)
   - This is very important because often the J-E dictionary won't be detailed
     enough to point out nuances and slight differences between synonyms
 - Google `「word1」 「word2」 どう違う` and read the (usually) Japanese explanation
 - Use [[7507c939]] to check how the two words differ in context with real
   sentences and usage
