# Western Governors University

Western Governors University (WGU) is a private, non-profit, online university based in Millcreek, Utah. 
The university uses an online competency-based learning model, providing advanced education for working professionals.

My intention for this section of my site is to share and document my experience throughout
WGU's Data Analytics Masters program.

This place will mostly be a dump of my thoughts and opinions on the courses required for completion of the program.
