# Onyomi and Kunyomi

The question of "**How do I read this kanji?**" is a common point of confusion
among beginners of Japanese.

The truth is: for every kanji you encounter there will always be multiple ways
to read it based on how it is used in a sentence. This is because **kanji
aren't words**. The spoken words are representative of the pronunciation, not
the individual kanji.

Take for example the following emojis: 🚗 ✈ 🇬🇧

Now read the following sentences:
 - "There are a lot of 🚗 on the road."
 - "I bought a new 🚗 today."

You probably read 🚗 as `cars` (plural) in the first and `car` (singular) in the
second sentence.

Take now the following examples:
 - "I ✈ to 🇬🇧  for the holidays."
 - "The stewardess on the ✈ did not speak 🇬🇧 at all."

You probably read ✈ as  `flew` or `travelled` in the first sentence, and `plane`
in the second one, while you read 🇬🇧 as  `England` in the first sentence and
`English` in the second one.

This is because our brain completes the gaps with **words** we already know, as
the language exists before the emojis. Emojis are just used as a substitute for
the actual words, and depending on the sentence they will be read in different
ways. The same thing (just a bit more complicated) applies to kanji.

## "Japanese" words

Due to the need to adopt a completely foreign logographic writing system over
their own native language, when Japanese came across kanji they merged them on
top of the already existing words that were spoken at the time.

These *Japanese words* are called <ruby>和語<rt>わご</rt></ruby> (Japanese words).
The choice of which kanji to use to represent which word was based on which
meaning was originally assigned to each symbol in Chinese, but the pronunciation
was kept the same as the original Japanese one.

As a (historically incorrect) example:

The word たべる (to eat) got assigned the kanji 食 which meant “meal” or “food”
 in Chinese, and it became <ruby>食<rt>た</rt></ruby>べる. This was done
completely independently of the Chinese pronunciation of the symbol 食.

This is called a <ruby>訓読<rt>くんよ</rt></ruby>み (Japanese reading) for the
kanji 食.

If you notice, <ruby>訓読<rt>くんよ</rt></ruby>み often have a "stem" or base in
kanji and some extra hiragana attached at the end. When this happens, their reading
will often be represented with a dot or a pair of parentheses in a dictionary.

For example:

食 → た **.** べる or た(べる)


## "Chinese" words

To make things more complicated, people weren’t happy with just having kanji
represent the original Japanese words. Due to the strong cultural and religious
influences from China, they actually took and assimilated *Chinese words*,
phrases, and proverbs into Japanese.

During this process, since they needed to import Chinese pronunciation into
the Japanese phonetic system, they created separate readings that deviated
significantly from their original Chinese versions.

These words are called <ruby>漢語<rt>かんご</rt></ruby> (Chinese words). They
are usually (but not always!) compounds of multiple kanji together (called <ruby>熟語<rt>じゅくご</rt></ruby>).

To continue with the earlier example, the kanji 食 is used in the word <ruby>食事<rt>しょくじ</rt></ruby>
(meal) and is read しょく・じ. しょく being the <ruby>音読<rt>おんよ</rt></ruby>み
(Chinese reading) of the kanji 食.

In dictionaries, it is common to represent <ruby>音読<rt>おんよ</rt></ruby>み
in katakana. For example:

食 → ショク


## Multiple readings

Without going into too many details on the why, we need to write a note about the
fact that it is very common for kanji to have multiple <ruby>音<rt>おん</rt></ruby>
and sometimes even <ruby>訓<rt>くん</rt></ruby> readings. When kanji were
imported from China, they arrived into Japan at very different times in history.
These large gaps in time delineated different historical periods within China,
who also had a significant restructuring of their own language at the time.
Because of this, the same word or symbol often got re-imported into Japan with
different readings, which fossilized into the language and are still in use today.

Furthermore, the kanji themselves also went through significant changes over the
years, as Japanese invented their own words and even distorted some of the
readings by joining different Chinese and Japanese variants together.

This is why it's sometimes **impossible** to know how a word written in kanji is
pronounced if you don't already know it, and why it's necessary instead to use
furigana or consult a dictionary.

You can think of <ruby>音読<rt>おんよ</rt></ruby>み and <ruby>訓読<rt>くんよ</rt></ruby>み
as the equivalent of Latin and Greek roots for modern European languages.
