# Mass Immersion Approach

**NOTE:** This page is kept for historical purposes. "MIA" split some time ago
into [[Refold]] and [[Migaku]].

Quoting directly from [their website](https://massimmersionapproach.com/about/):

> The final vision for MIA is twofold:
>
> First—a series of self-contained articles that, when consumed in chronological
> order, will equip learners with everything they need to understand and apply
> the most efficient language acquisition techniques. Topics ranging from
> language acquisition theory, to psychology and motivation, to the nitty-gritty
> of obtaining media and creating flashcards, will all be explained in clear and
> straightforward language.
>
> And second—an extensive toolkit of apps and programs that help learners
> automate and optimize the language learning process.

They have a lot of interesting and somewhat useful resources, but towards the
end of 2020 their two creators (Matt and Yoga) decided to split up the
partnership due to internal problems. The two new projects for each of them
respectively are [[Refold]] and [[Migaku]].
