# Japanese writing systems

There's 4 different writing system in Japanese.

## [Romaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese)

This is basically just latin alphabet applied to Japanese phonetic. It's used to
convey Japanese sounds to non-Japanese speakers/languages and those not familiar
with the traditional Japanese writing systems.

## [Hiragana](https://www.imabi.net/hiragana.htm)

Symbols like あいうえお,たちつてと, etc. This is the bread and butter of
Japanese. You can spell every single word using this syllabary.

## [Katakana](https://www.imabi.net/katakana.htm)

Symbols like アイウエオ,タチツテト, etc. It is almost the same as hiragana,
except it's often used to spell foreign words or to give a bold/italics-like
emphasis to Japanese words. You can compare it to WRITING IN ALL CAPS in
English.

## [[[Kanji]]]

This is the Chinese [logographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram)
writing system that has been historically adpoted by Japanese centuries ago due
to Chinese influence.
