# Japanese - Frequently Asked Questions

Hanging around Japanese learning communities, I see the following questions all
the time. In most cases, the answer is always the same and it involves a quick
link to a page with (what I consider) the best explanation currently available.

If what you're looking for is not here, consider also reading the
[[[Unlocking-Japanese-Tricks]]] page.
