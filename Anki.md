# Anki

Anki is a spaced repetition software (SRS) for flashcards. The better
explanation can be found on the [project's website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

In general, Anki takes the concept of [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)
in the form of decks and flash cards and it shows them to you in a specific
order to help you memorize them.

As long as you keep using Anki every day, you will be able to remember the
information that is being shown to you.

Most people among the [[Japanese]] learning community use it to learn various
things, mostly vocabulary and kanji (although it can also be used to train
listening comprehension or practice on grammar points as well).

## Pre-Made Decks

There are a lot of decks (i.e. collection of cards) made by others that can be
downloaded and added, and this is the most popular option for beginners. They
can be found directly on the [official website](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/japanese).


## Downside of Anki

By default, Anki has pretty terrible settings which can (and most likely will)
lead to burn out and regrets and you'll start to hate the software. They can be
extremely merciless, especially if you skip a couple of days or more of reviews
and they start piling up quickly.
