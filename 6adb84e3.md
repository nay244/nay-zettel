# JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test)

The JLPT, or in full Japanese Language Proficiency Test, is, as the name implies,
one of the most famous and widely recognized certificates to measure a peron's
Japanese language proficiency level.

There's more details on it on its [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test)
page.

## Note on proficiency

This is a personal note, but it's pretty commonly echoed among the [[Japanese]]
learning community so it's nothing too controversial.

A big criticism of the JLPT is the fact that it does not test any actual
**language output** proficiency. All its exams are focused on grammar knowledge,
reading comprehension, (relatively minor) kanji recognition, and listening
comprehension.

It is not uncommon for someone to pass the so-called N1 level (highest JLPT
rank) and still be relatively awkward/bad at making conversation or *using* the
language itself. It is apparently extremely common for Chinese native speakers
to have a much easier time passing the JLPT due to kanji knowlege and still not
be proficient in the language at all.

## Advantages of the JLPT

There are only a few reasons I can think of as for why anyone would want to get
their hands on a JLPT certificate.

The first and foremost: personal satisfaction. If you just want to have
something that attests you *achieved* something and your studies were not in
vain, then this is great and go do it. There's nothing wrong with that and it
can be a good motivator. You have a deadline and something to work towards,
sometimes that's all you need and it makes quite a difference.

This said, there are a couple other possible reasons. Just keep in mind that
the following list **only applies to N2 and N1 levels**. Anything below N2 (N5
through N3) is effectively worthless aside personal pride.

 * **Scholarships** - Apparently if you have JLPT certifications, some
   schools and universities in Japan will provide some financial aids which can
   be quite substantial if you're a student.
 * **HSFP visa points** - For the high-skilled foreign professional visa
   immigration system, the JLPT certification counts as points that can help
   you achieve a higher level (which is a faster path towards permanent
   residency status)
 * **Employment seeking in Japan** - This is not something that I'm familiar
   with myself, but apparently certain employers in Japan might require proof of
   Japanese proficiency via JLPT. However, arguably, you should be able to
   demonstrate that even without a JLPT certificate during an interview anyway.

## Alternative tests

There are some alternatives to JLPT that learners might be interested in.

There's the [BJT - Business Japanese Proficiency Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Japanese_Proficiency_Test)
which is significantly harder and higher level than the JLPT and provides a
much clearer signal on one's own *actual* proficiency. It is however not as
widespread in the west as the JLPT so if you do not live in Japan/Asia it might
be harder to find a location that tests for it.

There is also the [Kanji Kentei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_Kentei)
kanji aptitude test. This test is not specifically targeted to foreigners and
it's actually mostly taken by Japanese nationals. It varies from relatively
easy in the lower levels to insanely hard at the very top. Most Japanese
nationals would probably not be able to pass the highest levels, and a foreigner
doing that would be something of note for sure. It is a test aimed specifically
at kanji and vocabulary. It tests all kinds of kanji knowledge like meanings,
usage (including specific nuances), readings, variants, and also handwriting.
