# Practical Tips to Facilitate Early Reading

Being able to read for your own personal enjoyment is one of the best ways to acquire a
language.

However, especially when it comes to Japanese, there are quite a few obstacles
in the path of a beginner that may seem insurmountable. Unlike most other
languages, with Japanese you not only have to contend with grammar and
vocabulary, you need to think about [[Kanji]] and their phonetic
oddities/readings as well (See: [[Onyomi-and-Kunyomi]]).

A tip I like to give beginners that are trying to get into reading is that you
should **not worry about kanji**. In the past, kanji were a very big obstacle
for Japanese learners because we used to read on paper books. We did not have
the technology and tooling that we have today, so we had to rely on actually
cramming and stuffing a lot of kanji in our brains before we could even consider
reading a book. We had big bulky dictionaries and even reading a simple sentence
could take hours of flipping the pages back and forth.

Thankfully, this is not the case anymore. There are ways for you to jump
straight into reading manga or (digital) books, you just need to use the right
tools for it.

## Yomichan

[Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/) is an amazing browser
extension that every single Japanese learner should install. Let me repeat:
**you NEED to get this**.

By just moving your mouse over a word you don’t know, it will tell you the
reading, pronunciation, meaning, translation, and a bunch of other details about
it. By clicking a button you will also be able to export not only the word but
**the entire sentence** into your [[Anki]] deck if you have set it up using
ankiconnect.

There is a great explanation and set up guide on [this page](https://learnjapanese.moe/yomichan/)
that goes into more details about the whole process. Alternatively, [this one](https://animecards.site/yomichansetup/)
is also great. Give both of them a read.

## Kindle + Highlights

Ever since I started reading books on kindle, my Japanese reading life has
changed significantly. Now, I know I sound like an ad, but it is simply true.
Nobody is paying me to say this (unfortunately). There are other ebook readers
out there, but I haven’t used them so I can’t speak too much about them. I will,
however, write a bit about Kindle and more importantly its highlights feature.

First of all, let me clarify. I am talking about the **physical** kindle device.
Not the android/iOS/PC/Cloud app. There are unfortunately some problems with
those apps when it comes to Japanese. They are tricky to set up with custom
dictionaries and they do not support verb deconjugation. If you don’t know what
that is, don’t worry about it, but understand that it makes it harder for you to
look up words you don’t know.


The physical kindle device, on the other hand, is great for learning Japanese.
You can look up words by just tapping on them. You can install custom
dictionaries to your preference (I recommend getting started with [this one](https://github.com/jrfonseca/jmdict-kindle)),
and you can make highlight notes for every new word or expression you want to
keep track of.

I like using the highlight system to keep count of new words I learn as I read,
and then use a tool like [this one](https://github.com/kanjieater/Smart-Japanese-Kindle-Highlights)
to bulk import all my highlights automatically into [[6cfc2b98]] cards for
review later.

## Textractor and Game2Text

If actual novels aren’t your cup of tea, and you’d rather read visual novels or
play video games, there are also tools to help with that. [This page](https://learnjapanese.moe/vn/)
goes over all you need to know about setting up a tool called [textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor)
to be able to automatically extract and look up text from visual novels.

On the other hand, if you prefer video games, or the visual novel you want to
read does not support textractor, there is also another great tool called
[game2text](https://game2text.com/welcome/) that I strongly recommend.

## Manga with Furigana

While manga is my number one recommendation for a beginner to get into reading
Japanese, it also presents a problem that ebooks and visual novels don’t have:
in manga pages you cannot easily extract text to look up.

There are some small sites like [bilingualmanga](https://bilingualmanga.net/)
that try to offer you a platform where you can copy and paste the text in
balloons, but the amount of stuff you can read from them is very limited, often
has typos, or gets taken down as it’s copyrighted material.

On the other hand, a lot of manga aimed towards younger audiences (which makes
it great for beginners too!) has [[Furigana]] for every single kanji. This makes
it easier to read and look up words, and you will not need any fancy tools to do
so. If you can buy physical manga as well, it can be quite nice to read on the
couch away from all technology and distractions. Just you, your manga, and your
dictionary.
