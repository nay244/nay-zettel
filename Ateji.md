# Ateji

If only the topic of kanji readings could stop at [[Onyomi-and-Kunyomi]], kanji
would be much simpler to learn. In reality, however, Japanese words have a lot
of exception classes and phonetic situations that don’t conform to a
one-size-fits-all rule.

One of these situations is *ateji* (<ruby>当<rt>あ</rt>て</ruby><ruby>字<rt>じ</rt></ruby>)
readings.

<ruby>当<rt>あ</rt>て</ruby><ruby>字<rt>じ</rt></ruby> are arbitrarily
assigned special readings of kanji compounds that follow either one of these two
distinct rules:
 * Use kanji phonetically in foreign borrowed words because of their
   sound/reading, irrespective of their actual meanings;
 * Use kanji semantically due to their meaning, irrespective of their actual
   pronunciation/readings.

It’s good to point out that these two rules are basically the opposite of
each other. And yet, both of these categories get commonly referred to as
<ruby>当<rt>あ</rt>て</ruby><ruby>字<rt>じ</rt></ruby>.

## "Real" Ateji

For the first class of <ruby>当<rt>あ</rt>て</ruby><ruby>字<rt>じ</rt></ruby>,
kanji used for their **sounds**, we have some interesting words like <ruby>亜<rt>ア</rt>細<rt>ジ</rt>亜<rt>ア</rt></ruby>
(あ + じ + あ = アジア = Asia) or <ruby>亜<rt>ア</rt>米<rt>メ</rt>利<rt>リ</rt>加<rt>カ</rt></ruby>
(あ + め + り + か = アメリカ = America).

As you can see, in this usage, the *phonetic* role of the kanji is important,
and for this reason it's common to write the furigana on top of these words as
katakana.

The practice of using kanji like this has been mostly superseded in modern
Japanese thanks to the usage of katakana for loan words, but some of these still
remain floating around albeit not as commonly anymore.

## Jukujikun

On the other hand the second class of <ruby>当<rt>あ</rt>て</ruby><ruby>字<rt>じ</rt></ruby>,
called jukujikun (<ruby>熟字訓<rt>じゅくじくん</rt></ruby>), is still very much
in use today.

One example is <ruby>今朝<rt>けさ</rt></ruby> which is written with the
kanji 今 (now) and 朝 (morning) to mean “this morning”. However, neither of
these kanji alone have any readings that would map to けさ: the word itself
“けさ” as “this morning” only exists as its own standalone unit formed by those
two kanji in an inseparable manner.

Other similar words are <ruby>大和<rt>やまと</rt></ruby> (Japanese ethnicity)
with the kanji big (大) and japan (和), and <ruby>煙草<rt>タバコ</rt></ruby>
(tobacco) with smoke (煙) + grass (草) (although you’ll often see it written in
katakana alone).

When it comes to these <ruby>熟字訓<rt>じゅくじくん</rt></ruby> the only way to
know how they are pronounced is to look them up in a dictionary, because
the kanji themselves will not give you any certainty on their reading.
