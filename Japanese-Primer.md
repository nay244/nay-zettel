# Japanese Primer

If you're confused by the huge amount of resources and options available to you
and just want to learn Japanese, here's what I recommend.

As always, this is just my **personal opinion**. There's no best way: what works
for me might not work for you. Don't stress it, if something is not working out
then use something else.

If you disagree with what I've written here, that's okay too. I'm not the
ultimate authority on Japanese learning.

## READ THIS FIRST:

**FIRST**:

Learn [Hiragana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/) and
[Katakana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/).

**THEN**:

Learn Grammar + Vocab + [[Kanji]]

**Do NOT** skip ahead, do kana first. Japanese will still be there after you're
done with them don't worry.

## Grammar

 * Read [Sakubi](https://sakubi.neocities.org/) if you value independence and
   just want to read native material as soon as possible.

 * Read [Genki](http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/index_en) if you want a textbook.

## Vocab

 * Install and learn how to use [[Anki]] (Also read [this page](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/c/srs-best-practices))

 * Grab a core deck and start learning **core** vocab. My recommendation is to
   get the N5 and N4 [ankidrone starter pack](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/basic-vocabulary#anki-deck)
   decks (first do the N5, and then the N4 one).

 * Once you're finished with those, start [sentence mining](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-2/a/basic-sentence-mining).

## Kanji

You don't need to worry about kanji, they can wait for later. Focus on learning
**vocab** (words) and you will learn to recognize kanji as you go. You'll figure
out what to do about it later, trust me.

It is **much** easier to learn kanji if you already know a lot of words, so just
learn those words. No need to rush it. Read stuff with [[Furigana]] at first so
you won't have to worry about it. Use [yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/)
to read on the web. See also: [[[Practical-Tips-to-Facilitate-Early-Reading]]]

## Extra

 - Bookmark [[Japanese-Frequently-Asked-Questions]] and
   [[Unlocking-Japanese-Tricks]] and **read them** every time you are confused
   about something.
 - Read [[[58465ab9]]] if you want a more general overview.
 - Read [[9f88358f]] if you want alternative options to the resources mentioned
   above. I also go in more details about each of them.
 - Read [[e50a5ae3]] if you're looking for something to read that might suit a
   beginner.
