# Refold

[Refold.la](https://refold.la) is the new project from Matt who was the original
creator of the [[4f5f4e00]] method. It carries on pretty much the same philosophy
and methodology.

The website and method are extremely cultish and some of their followers can be
some real vocal fans with a cult of personality around Matt himself, but still
they have some solid ideas that they try to panhandle you as this new
groundbreaking method.

Nonetheless, there's some good resources for [[6cfc2b98]] and similar tools
that might be worth checking out.
