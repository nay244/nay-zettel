# Japanese Learning Resources

This is a mostly scattered collection of sites, tooling, and all kind of things
that can help you learn [[Japanese]].

## Comprehensive Guides

### [Itazuraneko](https://djtguide.github.io/library/sub.html)

4chan's /djt/ (Daily Japanese Thread) guide. I don't think it's very
beginner friendly but it has *a lot* of content and sections for all kind of
topics on how to learn Japanese.

### [Refold](https://refold.la/mia/)

New approach to MIA (see point below). The core ideas a pretty much the same as
that one, really.

### [Mass Immersion's Approach](https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/stage-1/jp-quickstart-guide/)

MIA's specific quick start guide on how to study Japanese using the
[[4f5f4e00]] tools and resources. MIA's focus is on extensive immersion and
natural acquisition of the language. It is worth checking out for the amount of
resources they have mostly related to [[Anki]] but ever since the split
most of them are under the [[Migaku]] umbrella now.

### [Awesome Japanese Beginner Guide](https://github.com/EngJpDiscordExchange/Awesome-Japanese/blob/master/readme.md#beginner-guide)

This is really a collection of various tools, textbooks, links, etc (similar to
this very own page). It's a collaborative project from various people at the
[[EJLX]]# discord.

### [r/LearnJapanese Beginner Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/wiki/index/startersguide)

The official beginner's wiki for the Japanese learning subreddit.

While personally I would not recommend spending too much time on the subreddit,
their wiki is a decent entry point before branching off in your studies.

### [Wasabi's Japanese Self-Learning Guides](https://my.wasabi-jpn.com/curriculum/self-learning-japanese/)

Wasabi-Jpn is a site/project with a lot of resources for people learning
Japanese. Among them, there is also a self-learning guide.

I personally haven't gone through the whole guide myself, however I have read a
lot of the articles. The way they expose the grammar seems to be solid to me,
however I have noticed a lot of English mistakes and weird explanations. They
do not make understanding necessarily harder but they can be a bit weird to
parse at times. Your mileage may vary.

## Textbooks

### [Genki](http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/index_en)

The go-to de-facto textbook for Japanese beginners that want to learn in a
classroom-like setting with structured lessons and workbook exercises.

Pretty much everyone will tell you to get Genki if you want to start learning
Japanese. Personally, I'm not a big fan and I prefer the Japanese for Busy
People series, however I seem to be in the minority.

### [Japanese For Busy People](https://www.ajalt.org/english/textbooks/japanese_for_busy_people.html)

Another textbook like Genki with a classroom-like lesson structure. It covers
about the same topics as Genki, and personally it's what I've used myself. I
would recommend it over Genki as I found it to have a better format, but overall
they are very similar. Get the kana version, don't even bother with the romaji
one([[99eaf9c2]]).

### [Japanese the Manga Way](https://www.tofugu.com/reviews/japanese-the-manga-way/)

This textbook is very interesting to me. It attempts to provide some kind of
crash course to Japanese grammar by real world examples of manga snippets.
It's great for beginners and covers a surprisingly large amount of grammar
condensed into a relatively low number of pages. I used it mostly to learn
basic particles and sentence structure as a beginner and it carried me a long
way, surprisingly.

### [An Introduction to Modern Japanese](https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Modern_Japanese_Volum.html?id=Gu3k3eiOXWAC&redir_esc=y)

Relatively old (2004?) and hard to come by textbook. I include it here because
albeit extremely expensive for what it's worth and hard to find online, it
provides a very "different" approach to modern Japanese learning practices.
The book itself is very intensive and is not afraid to jump into complex
Japanese from the get go, every chapter is introduced with a quite meaty
block of conversation/text to immerse in. No furigana, extensive use of kanji.
It definitely does not hold a beginner's hand through its material, but I found
it to be very interesting and appreciated it for what it is.

Definitely **not** essential, but if you can get your hands on a copy as a side
read it can be quite an experience.

### [Tobira](http://tobiraweb.9640.jp/introduction/%e3%80%8e%e3%81%a8%e3%81%b3%e3%82%89%e3%80%8f%e3%81%ae%e7%89%b9%e5%be%b4/)

Following Genki, this seems to be the de-facto material to use. I see this being
recommended every time after someone finishes with their Genki studies, although
I have never tried it myself.

## Grammar


### [Imabi](https://imabi.org)

This site is *crazy*. There's pretty much *everything* you may want to know
about the Japanese language grammar.

However, it's extremely verbose and can be very confusing/convoluted in the
explanations even for the simplest grammatical concepts. It's great to look up
individual grammar points if you want to get the finer intricacies and
subtleties of the language, but I wouldn't use it as a textbook alone.

### [Tae Kim](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/)

Often proclaimed as *the* entry point to learn Japanese grammar for beginners.
I personally haven't used it much and I've read a lot of criticism about the way
he approaches some explanations (sometimes even incorrectly). Overall, it seems
to work really well for a lot of people so it must be doing some things right at
least.

### [Sakubi](https://sakubi.neocities.org/)

Probably my favorite beginner grammar introduction. I really like the hands on
approach. I compare it content-wise with Tae Kim with the difference that it's
much more brisk and straight to the point. The main core of the guide is to
get you to become *aware* of certain grammar structures and sentence style so
you can become more independent and start reading as early as possible without
getting stuck on overly complex explanations or textbook exercises. It's not for
everybody but it really resonates strongly with me and I think it's a good idea
to read over it at least once.

### [An Introduction to Japanese](https://pomax.github.io/nrGrammar/)

Probably one of my favorite grammar overviews of the Japanese language when it
comes to information density and format. It's great for looking up structure
and grammar to get a thorough mental map of how some aspects of the Japanese
language works.

It is not to be used as a beginner resource or as a learning textbook. I like
to re-read it once in a while as my language knowledge improves to further
cement the fundamentals and broaden my understanding.

Just note that it's been written by a **non native** and I've actually found a
few inaccuracies or incorrect statements here and there. It's not a big deal
but just be aware of it and don't get too attached to everything that's written
there.

### [Cure Dolly's Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdmU8hGK4Fg3LghTVtKltQ)

While I am not a fan of the video format and the way Dolly speaks (still not
sure if it's a filter, an act of playing a character, or what), I think the
way they approach the Japanese grammar is somewhat decent and it at least tries
to explain grammar concepts in a less English-focused traditional way.

I personally cannot stand the video format and some of the videos can be quite
inaccurate or reductionist but from a generalist's point of view they aren't
bad. I do think it'd be better to have them in written format as they are very
time consuming to watch, but if you're into that sort of stuff it might work for
you.

### [A dictionary of Basic/Intermediate/Advanced Japanese Grammar](https://www.tofugu.com/reviews/dictionary-of-basic-japanese-grammar/)

These three books are exactly what the name implies. A literal dictionary of all
possible grammar points in the Japanese language. Use them to look up individual
grammar points, they are *really* good.

I believe if anyone is even remotely serious about learning the language, these
are absolutely **essential** to have. I prefer them on paper but there are
digital version too.

### [A Handbook of Japanese Grammar Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Japanese-Patterns-Teachers-Learners/dp/4874246788)

This book is the complementary of the dictionaries of Japanese grammar mentioned
above. It is a very hands-on dictionary-like approach to a *huge* number of
various Japanese grammar patterns. Integrating both of them together provides
you with an almost 100% coverage of all Japanese grammar points. The
explanations are very extensive with plenty of examples too.
If you are feeling confident in your Japanese abilities, there's also a Japanese
version (the original I think) which I would recommend as it is how this index
was meant to be experienced.

## Useful Sites to Bookmark

### [Core6000 Neocities's](https://core6000.neocities.org/) and [Itazuraneko's](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/grammar/masterreference.html) aggregates

This is not a single resource per-se, but they are aggregates/index lists of
all the dictionaries of japanese grammar and handbook of japanese grammar
patterns entries (mentioned above) into a single place for easy browsing. **If
you could only bookmark and save a single website, either one of these would be
it**. This is *really* almost all you'll ever need.

### [Japanese Counter Index](https://www.benricho.org/kazu/ho.html)

This site has a list of various counters to look up based on what words you
need to count. It's a very useful resource to have at hand.

### [Tsukuba Web Corpus](http://nlt.tsukuba.lagoinst.info/search/)

This is a great site with a *a lot* of content. It is an aggregate search site
for various Japanese idioms and grammatical patterns. It is used best to look
up and drill down specific words and grammar patterns to find out example
sentences and see how they are used in natural language composition.

### [The Jaded Network SFX](http://thejadednetwork.com/sfx)

Amazing website to look up onomatopoeias and onomatopoeic words.

### [jpdb](https://jpdb.io/)

Very interesting project, it tries to be some kind of Japanese-learning/study
tool, but where it really shines in my opinion is the curated and well
maintained list of novels, visual novels, anime, etc sorted by complexity and
word frequency. It lets you create your own decks, export to anki, and a bunch
of other fancy stuff.

## Apps

### [Anki]

Self-explanatory, just read the linked page.

### [Wanikani](https://www.wanikani.com/)

I have personally never used it myself, so I can't give a personal opinion on
it. However, I know plenty of people that vouch for it as a really good
alternative to RTK/Core anki decks both for kanji learning and for core
vocabulary SRS practice. It is a paid resource though, so be aware of that, but
it seems worth it. If I were starting from scratch myself now I'd probably give
it a go.


### [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/)

This is a must-have browser extension. It tells you how words are read and what
they mean with dictionary definition as you move your mouse cursor over them
in your browser.
