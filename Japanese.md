# Japanese

The Japanese learning community is incredibly resourceful, and it can be quite
daunting for a beginner to know where to start.

My intention for this **personal** section of my site is to contextualize
various resources scattered everywhere and record a heterogeneous learning
method to make sense of Japanese.

I don't really have any plans to make this into a thorough and comprehensive repository, just
a place to dump all kind of scattered resources.

For a quick primer, read [[[Japanese-Primer]]].
