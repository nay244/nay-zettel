# D214 - Data Analytics Graduate Capstone
The Data Analytics Graduate Capstone allows students to apply the academic and professional abilities developed as a graduate student. This capstone challenges students to integrate skills and knowledge from several program domains into one project. Advanced Data Analytics is a prerequisite for this course.

## Course Analysis
This course is structured around three main tasks:

Task 1: Capstone Approval and Release Form
The majority of time for this task was revolved around finding a suitable topic for analysis that would be challenging and interesting, while also having a real world use case. I spent maybe several hours alone just looking into various datasets, mostly on Kaggle, downloading several and conducting EDA to attempt to find a dataset that I would like to work with for the entirety of the course. In the end I decided to settle on U.S. Food Imports Data sourced from United States Department of Agriculture. The dataset can be found here [U.S. Food Imports](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-food-imports).

Task 2: Data Analytics Report and Executive Suummary


Task 3: Executive Summary and Implications
