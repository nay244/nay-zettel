# EJLX

This is the **E**nglish **J**apanese **L**anguage **E**xchange discord server.

You can find it at [discord.gg/japanese](https://discord.gg/japanese).

There is a vibrant community of people, both native Japanese speakers and
Japanese learners, willing to practice the language together (via text or voice
chat). There's also a lot of places where it is possible to ask questions, find
help/guidance for your studies, or just chill and relax with similarly-minded
folks.
