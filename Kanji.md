# Kanji

This section is still getting expanded as I do more research and collect my
thoughts, however if you want a kickstart course on kanji I recommend reading
the following links:
 * [Tofugu: ON'YOMI and KUN'YOMI IN KANJI: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/onyomi-kunyomi/)

## What are Kanji?

You can think of kanji as something similar to very specialized emojis. If you
take the Japanese *spoken* language and put it into writing, you can decide to
write words in hiragana, katakana, or add extra flavor with kanji.

Kanji have a lot of different uses, but probably the most evident one is
to make it easier to distinguish word boundaries (as traditional Japanese does
not use spaces) and to differentiate between homonyms (words pronounced the same
but with different meanings).

It is common to teach kanji to foreigners by assigning an English
keyword/meaning to each symbol. However, I think it’s more appropriate to think
of them as individual components that act as replacement for already existing
words in the language. While an individual kanji can carry certain meanings and
connotations, in reality it will always be a representation of a real Japanese
*word*.

* Some words can be replaced with a single individual kanji:
  * にく(meat) can be replaced with just <ruby>肉<rt>にく</rt></ruby>.
* Some other words can instead be composed of multiple kanji in sequence:
  * くも (spider) can be written as <ruby>蜘<rt>くも</rt>蛛</ruby>.
* Some take the form of combinations of a fixed kanji “root” and some additional
  conjugations in hiragana (called okurigana):
  * The verb のむ (to drink) is <ruby>飲<rt>の</rt></ruby>む and its
    conjugations modify the む part of the word (<ruby>飲<rt>の</rt></ruby>まない,
    <ruby>飲<rt>の</rt></ruby>める, <ruby>飲<rt>の</rt></ruby>んで, etc)

It is important to understand the relationship that the kanji symbols have with
the actual *readings* of the words they represent, otherwise you might end up
thinking that kanji are words. **Kanji are not words**, they are a
**typographical representation** of a spoken language.

## Origin of Kanji (short version)

**NOTE**: This is a very brief summary, it's not meant to be a historically
accurate and thorough explanation.

A long time ago, the ancestor language of modern Japanese existed only as
spoken language within the island of Japan. It did not have a writing system.
One day a bunch of scholars arrived from China and brought into the country
a multitude of Chinese scriptures and other ornamental tools full of kanji.

Japan, needing a writing system for itself, decided to adopt these symbols for
its own literature. A bunch of transformations happened to
the language over the centuries and we ended up with hiragana and katakana as
simplifications of [man’yogana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27y%C5%8Dgana)
(phonetic kanji) and [hentaigana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hentaigana).

Despite all this, the kanji system remained and eventually split from the
original Chinese version. Today you will see that Japanese kanji are often
different from (modern) Chinese symbols (called hanzi), although they still
share a lot of similarities.
