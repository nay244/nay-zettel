# Furigana

The practice of annotating phonetic readings on top of kanji words.

It is often (but not always) used to aid the person who is reading and might not
be familiar with certain kanji or spellings.

Furigana is also often called ['ruby' text or characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_character).

Example:

 * <ruby>魚<rt>さかな</rt></ruby>
 * <ruby>家<rt>いえ</rt></ruby>
 * <ruby>亜<rt>ア</rt>米<rt>メ</rt>利<rt>リ</rt>加<rt>カ</rt></ruby>
 * <ruby>Latin Text<rt>Furigana</rt></ruby>

As you can see, there's no hard rules about what goes in furigana. For some
[[Ateji]] words, you will often see katakana as furigana. Sometimes authors even
like having fun and put kanji as furigana for other kanji:

## Origins

When [[Kanji]] first arrived in Japan, it was used to render Chinese (usually
religious) scriptures. In the timespan of half a millennia-ish (400AD -> 1000AD)
kanji became not only a Chinese import, but also a representation of the local
language with complex pronunciations and readings (see: [[Onyomi-and-Kunyomi]]).

As a practice common in all Chinese territories at the time, like the Korean
peninsula or Vietnam, various glossings and annotations were added to these
Chinese scriptures to make it easier to scholars and Buddhist monks to recite
the text out loud in the local language/dialect.

In the same manner, these annotations were also used in Japan to distinguish
between words written in kanji as Chinese, and words written in kanji for
grammar or Japanese readings (as kana script had not yet been invented).

These annotations are called <ruby>訓点<rt>くんてん</rt></ruby> and the practice
of annotating classical Chinese texts (also called <ruby>漢文<rt>かんぶん</rt></ruby>)
is called <ruby>加点<rt>かてん</rt></ruby>.

## Modern Use

You'll find furigana everywhere and especially for Japanese learners it can be
a lifesaver. It makes it easier to read complex words and also makes it possible
to look up <ruby>熟語<rt>じゅくご</rt></ruby> by their readings in a dictionary
insead of having to rely on radical search or having to draw the kanji (see
also: [[How-do-I-look-up-the-meaning-of-this-kanji]]).

Depending on the publisher and the author's own preferences, books will
sometimes follow certain established rules on where to apply furigana:

 * On a lot of young reader's manga like <ruby>少年<rt>しょうねん</rt></ruby> or
  <ruby>少女<rt>しょうじょ</rt></ruby> genres, you will see furigana on every
   single kanji word;
 * In some light novels or books, publishers will require all [[Ateji]] words to
   have their furigana reading clearly displayed;
 * Words that use non-<ruby>常用漢字<rt>じょうようかんじ</rt></ruby> (kanji
   outside of those every adult is expected to know) will often have furigana;
 * Sometimes it's just totally random lol ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Another very common practice of using furigana is that of adding inconsistent or
unusual readings on top of certain kanji used as <ruby>義訓<rt>ぎくん</rt></ruby>
for poetic or literary purposes. See: [[[Gikun]]]
