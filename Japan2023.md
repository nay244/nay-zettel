# Japan 2023
From over 2 years since the initial discussion to the months of planning and discussing our trip to Japan, a journey that started as a shared dream among a few close friends, finally became a reality. 
This trip was more than just a brief break from our lives in the States; it was the culmination of countless hours spent discussing activities of interest, and excited chats about all the places to explore. 
As the months passed, our adventure grew in an unexpected but welcome way â€“ friends we had known only online were now joining us, turning our group into a unique blend of old and new friendships. 
Meeting these friends in person for the first time, in a country most of us had never been to before, added an indescribable excitement to our already anticipated journey.

However, thats not to say that Japan as a country is a great place to live. While there and interacting with the locals and just observing daily life, I realized that being a tourist there was something far different than actually living there. On the surface, Japan appears to be a highly advanced, technologically advanced, low-crime and culturally rich society, but it's a society that seems to be completely dominated by group identity. Everything is about the group, nothing is about ones self. Also, Japan's work culture is accompanied by its uown nique set of challenges, such as the grueling work hours, fierce competition for jobs, limited opportunities for career advancement, and noticeable gender disparities. These aspects create a multifaceted impact on Japanese society as a whole, affecting the well-being of its people. So, while as a foreigner it was an amazing experience, I can't really see myself wanting to live here for long periods of time unless the situation changes.
