# Japan 2023
From over 2 years since the initial discussion to the months of planning and discussing our trip to Japan, a journey that started as a shared dream among a few close friends, finally became a reality. 
This trip was more than just a brief break from our lives in the States; it was the culmination of countless hours spent discussing activities of interest, and excited chats about all the places to explore. 
As the months passed, our adventure grew in an unexpected but welcome way â€“ friends we had known only online were now joining us, turning our group into a unique blend of old and new friendships. 
Meeting these friends in person for the first time, in a country most of us had never been to before, added an indescribable excitement to our already anticipated journey. This wasn't just a vacation; it was a celebration of friendship, adventure, and the incredible experience of exploring a land so rich in culture and beauty.
