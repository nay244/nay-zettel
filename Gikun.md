# Gikun (義訓)

Gikun are a specific literary device used in Japanese to add an extra layer of
poeticism or style to narrative text. It's a very commonly adopted and
widespread technique among many Japanese authors and chances are if you read
native material (even simple manga) it's very likely that you've come across it
yourself.

The fundamental idea behind <ruby>義訓<rt>ぎくん</rt></ruby> is to write words
with an incorrect kanji and annotate them using [[Furigana]] to instruct the
reader of the *actual* reading of the word that was supposed to be in their
place instead.

This specific usage of furigana adds a level of nuance that is hard to grasp
for someone who's not used to logographic languages: as westerners we aren't
used to separating the *form* from the *meaning* in our written texts, however
in Japanese this kind of parallel is very common to make. The closest comparison
I can make would be that of metaphors.

Take the following English sentence:

 * "He has no fear, he's a lion"

And now let's annotate it:

 * "He has no fear, he's <ruby>a lion<rt>very brave</rt></ruby>"

You can think of <ruby>義訓<rt>ぎくん</rt></ruby> as something like that.

## Examples

![Gikun example 1](./static/gikun_example_1.png)

 「大人が<b><ruby>子供達<rt>ぼくたち</rt></ruby></b>を殺す気持ち」でも？

</center>

In this panel from 約束のネバーランド Norman *says* the word ぼくたち ("us")
but the actual text in kanji spells 子供達 ("kids", plural). Normally you'd read
that as こどもたち, however the furigana indicates that the word he spoke is
actually different.

This <ruby>義訓<rt>ぎくん</rt></ruby> is the perfect example of using kanji and
its reading to gain extra nuance that would otherwise have been impossible to
have. By analyzing this panel we know these two facts:

 * By *saying* "us" (ぼくたち), Norman is including himself and his close
   friends into the group.
 * By *writing* "kids" (こどもたち), the author is specifically telling the
   reader that it's not just Norman and his friends, he's talking about all the
   kids in the orphanage.

 これで<b><ruby>GP<rt>ここ</rt></ruby></b>を出た先

</center>

Another example from 約束のネバーランド. This time the <ruby>義訓<rt>ぎくん</rt></ruby>
is much more utilitarian and less poetic. The author makes sure to specify that
when the character says ここ ("here"), he's actually talking about the place
they are at and reminds the reader that the location is called "GP".

![Gikun example 3](./static/gikun_example_3.jpg)

 ついに<b><ruby>わたし<rt>クマ</rt></ruby></b>が登場する

</center>

In this example from the くまクマ熊ベアー light novel, the main character Yuna
(who is dressed like a bear) is writing a fictional story about an actual bear.
It is a bit of an auto-biographical in-universe joke story and, since she
identifies as the bear in the book she's writing, she uses the word わたし
("I") but the author annotates it with クマ ("bear") to make it clear for the
reader that she's not talking about herself but about the *actual* bear in the
story.
