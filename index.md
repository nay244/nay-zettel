# Nay

Hi, I am [[[About-Me]]].

Welcome to my personal website.

This site will serve as a companion on my journey to a well-examined life. It's where I weave together my thoughts, my learning, and my memories to create a narrative that's uniquely mine.
<br />

"<u>*Whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go, just remember how far you have come. Remember everything you have faced, all the battles you have won, and all the fears you have overcome.*</u>." - <b>[N.R. Walker](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/31997446)</b> (2016)


## Why?
In my journey for a richer learning experience and a more meaningful way to track my productivity and personal growth, I've started this Zettelkasten-type website. Here I will post stuff that I am comfortable relating to topics such as:

**Learning Resources:** Each note is a building block in an ever-expanding understanding of the world. I link ideas, which deepens my comprehension, and I can retrieve any piece of information in an instant. As my insights evolve, so do my notes.

**Productivity Tracking:** This system is my reflective mirror. It shows me where I've been and guides where I'm going. By interlinking tasks with my broader goals, I ensure that my daily actions align with my true priorities. Watching my progress unfold within this network of notes keeps me motivated and on track.

**Personal Life Diary:** My Zettelkasten is also the canvas of my life. It captures the essence of my personal stories, the lessons I learn, and the joy I find in everyday moments. It's a tool for self-discovery, helping me to see patterns in my life and understand my journey better. And one day, it will be a legacyâ€”a glimpse into my world for those I cherish.

## How to browse this site
In the true spirit of the Zettelkasten ideology, this webpage is to be a collection of notes.

In reality, it's more like a series of personal posts and diary of sorts that document my life that I felt comfortable releasing them to the public.
