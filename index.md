# Nay

Hi, I am [[[About-Me]]].

Welcome to my personal website.

This site is powered by Neuron and hosted on GH pages.

## Why?
I just like to write about stuff. It's a bit of a mix between my own personal blog and just a place where I dump all kinds of notes and thoughts so I can retrieve them later.

The idea is to gather all kind of stuff and map it in a Zettelkasten that can be freely browsed / consulted at any time, by anyone.

## How to browse this site
In the true spirit of the Zettelkasten ideology, this webpage is to be a collection of notes.

In reality, it's more like a series of personal posts and diary of sorts that document my life that I felt comfortable releasing them to the public.


## Curated Articles
