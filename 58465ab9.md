# Japanese Learning Loop

No matter what approach you are looking at, to achieve fluency in a language the
most important thing is being able to achieve **learning independence**. ([[[Unlocking-Japanese-Tricks]]])
In other words, being able to sustain your own studies and maintain a tangible
process of consistent self-improvement feedback loop.

The basis of this *language acquisition* loop are the same for any
language but the specifics may differ.

This is my approach to [[Japanese]] learning, I hope it can be useful to you as
it has been to me.

If you feel lost and just want a quick **tl;dr**: read [[Japanese-Primer]].

## Diagram

**NOTE**: The image has clickable links embedded. Click to expand the image to

Every person has different preferences when approaching language studies and,
while we all share the same baseline, we may prefer one way or the other.

At the end of the day, you should consider this loop as a loose guideline on
how to orient yourself in the landscape of Japanese learning, and learn to
take advantage of the various [[[9f88358f]]] at your disposal.

"<u>*I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but I can only show you the door.
You're the one that has to walk through it*</u>." - <b>[The Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc3VG9JZM6I)</b> (1999)

<br />

## Step 0: Foundation

Do not skip this step. It's really simple, just learn [hiragana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/)
(ひらがな) and [katakana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/) (カタカナ).

You really *really* **really** ***NEED*** this.

## Step 1: Basics

The three areas of **Grammar**, **Vocabulary**, and **Listening** should be
done more or less at the same time, they are independent and parallel with each
other, they will all equally help you unlock the path to the next stage when
you are ready.

### Grammar

You want be able to recognize word boundaries, which words are particles, how to
conjugate basic verbs, how to connect very basic of ideas, etc.

There's many resources to be consulted at this step. I recommend [Sakubi](https://sakubi.neocities.org/)
because it's a good quick read. Don't get stuck on the details, just read through
it and follow its advice and philosophy. **You can only fully understand grammar
after reading a lot of native material**. At this stage you just want to get a
general impression of how the language **looks**. You can come back to it later
as many times as you want if you need a refresher.

On the other hand, if you want a more structured, traditional, and slower
approach, you can try a textbook like Genki or Japanese the Manga Way.

**NOTE**: When you get to verb conjugation, I strongly recommend giving a quick
watch to [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHo3qUb79No) [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxib4q73vl8)
videos for a basic overview. They are **very** good and straight to the point.

What is important to remember here is that you are the one to decide how far you
want to take this. Your goal should be to transition to Step 2 as soon as you
feel ready to immerse in **native** material. Don't linger too long on this,
it is only a stepping stone to get you there.

  <summary>Optional: Bunpro</summary>

#### Bunpro

Bunpro is a great helper for grammar retention. Consider giving [[0c786881]]
a read as my personal recommendation on how to use it well. As you are still
in the Step 1 of the Loop, what you want out of it is to *leverage your
textbook* so you can get used to daily bunpro reviews in preparation for the
next step, which requires more independence. If you are using a textbook, make
sure to add it to your *study paths* to get the most out of it.

### Vocabulary

Knowing what words mean and how they are supposed to look is as important as
knowing when/how to use them.

#### Anki Core Deck

The purpose of a starting core deck for [[Anki]] is to get you started with
basic words that you absolutely need to be able to start reading native material
on your own. Later you will be building your own deck as you learn new words, so
don't get too attached to this one, it is but a starting point to get your feet
wet in *useful* Japanese.

The core decks I recommend for beginners are the N5 and N4 tango decks in the
[ankidrone starter pack](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/basic-vocabulary#anki-deck)
collection. Start from N5 and move to N4 after.

Don't get too hung up on finishing all of these decks (it's going to take you a
very long time). Just adding a good 500-1000 words to your toolbelt will likely
give you enough to get started and help you immensely for the next step.

There's various other starting decks for beginners, the most commonly recommended
one is the so-called [core6k deck](https://mega.nz/#!QIQywAAZ!g6wRM6KvDVmLxq7X5xLrvaw7HZGyYULUkT_YDtQdgfU).

Alternatively, if you want a deck that gets you up-to-speed faster, I recommend
the [VNCore1250 deck](https://mega.nz/#!GiAQzY7C!ZDTQH1Kl23E-UaVAWJWFKPe4Jx_Qk1moAvj2OnPNPto).
It contains the ~1200 most frequent words in Visual Novels. This also carries
over really well for anime, manga, and videogames too.

One tip for [[Anki]] in general is to change the default settings, because
they are horrible, so make sure to read up on that ([[31f3d49a]]) so you don't
suffer from burnout.

I won't specifically tell you to skip the next **optional** step, because some
people seem to get a lot out of it, however I did not do it myself and I'm not
very enthusiastic about it. I'm mentioning this anyway in order to not deprive
you of anything that might help you. Just realize that it's *not mandatory* and
if you aren't into it, you can skip it without issues.


<details>
  <summary>Optional: RTK</summary>

#### RTK

[Remembering The Kanji](https://kanji.koohii.com/) is a specific method of
[[Kanji]] study so that you can more easily become familiar at recalling the
shapes and loose meanings of each and every glyph. This is to make it easier
for you to later learn the actual words as you encounter them in the language.

There's multiple versions of it, although they're all mostly the same. Just
pick one and stick to it, but [be aware of Zipf's law](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ehn4w4/oc_visualizing_zipfs_law_in_japanese_kanji/) (90% of words you will encounter
contain only the first 1000 kanji). You don't **need** to overstudy these.

**This does not teach you any words**, it merely teaches you the overall *ideas*
and *meanings* of the symbols.

<br />
</details>

<!-- TODO: Write Zettel on RTK -->

<details>
  <summary>Optional: Wanikani</summary>

#### Wanikani
I have never used it myself, and I don't have any strong feelings about it
either way, but [Wanikani](https://www.wanikani.com/) seems to be a decent
**paid** tool to help with both kanji and (some) vocabulary. It can work as paid
alternative to **both** RTK *and* a core Anki deck, however the distribution of
words it teaches you is not as optimal as a core deck and its slower pace might
become frustrating if you just want to read stuff ASAP on your own.

### Listening

Japanese is a pitch accent language. A lot of people from English or other
European language backgrounds are unaware of the role of pitch in other
languages and are often even unable to properly hear it unless they specifically
train for it.

While **this is not a big problem** (you can still communicate using the wrong
pitch), learning how to **recognize** and **be aware** of pitch accent early on
will be immensely beneficial to your pronunciation.

I **strongly** recommend you get this sorted out as early as possible.

With some extremely minimal amount of effort, you can make insane gains in your
pitch awareness and pronunciation, and here's how:

 1. Watch [this Dogen video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6AoilGEers) about
   the fundamentals of pitch accent (it's just 10 minutes)
 2. Go to [this pitch accent test site](https://kotu.io/tests/pitchAccent/minimalPairs)
   and see how many words you can get right.

**NOTE**: The test requires you to sign up with an account but you can give it
any random username and pass and it won't matter. They don't even verify it.

If you cannot maintain a score above 90% consistently, you need to train your
hearing. Just keep doing the pitch accent test a little bit every day (you don't
have to be too strict, just do it whenever you have time) until you can hit the
95~100% mark. Once you are aware of pitch, try to listen for it in every word
and sentence you hear, it will change your life.

While it's always good to get acquainted with the phonetics, sounds, and pacing
of the language, at this stage there's not much else you should worry about.
Passive listening won't hurt you but it also won't help you that much, as you
lack both the grammar and vocabulary to properly immerse actively in anything
yet.

If you want, you can listen to Japanese music, leave some podcasts in the
background, watch anime with English subtitles and pay attention to the
dialogues, etc...

## Step 2: The Loop

**The Loop** consists of one preparatory step, and three core steps to follow.

### Sentence Mining Deck (preparation)

There's an [overall guide](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-2/a/basic-sentence-mining)
on sentence mining and sentence cards on the [[Refold]] website.

The idea is that you read native material, find stuff that you don't know, and
add it to this deck so you can review it later.

Once you have set up your mining deck and got the [workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfvDKgNUSi8)
down, you can begin *looping*.

### Discovery Phase

Following Krashen's [Input Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis),
we acquire language as we are exposed to **comprehensible input**.

Defining comprehensible input is tricky, but in layman's terms it simply
means don't bite more than you can chew. You might be tempted to jump into
complex material that interests you, but you are not going to have a good time
if you cannot find a good balance between consumption and dictionary lookups.

Ideally you want to find material that gives you at least 90% comprehension.
Having to look up one word or grammar point for every other sentence is a
healthy balance in my opinion, but also don't be too strict about it. Try to
**prioritize having a good time**, if you're feeling stressed out or aren't
having fun because the material is boring, too simple, too hard, or anything
in-between, find something else. The [affective filter](https://www.colorincolorado.org/glossary/affective-filter)
hypothesis tells us that **we acquire language more easily if we are having fun**,
so that should be your absolute priority.

Only you know what you find enjoyable, don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.

If you are worried about what you **should** be reading, consider giving this
article a read: [[[Optimal-Reading-Immersion---Narrow-Reading]]]. At the end of
the day, it really doesn't matter. Just try to find stuff you enjoy and stick
with it.

*However*, I'd recommend staying away from material specifically targeted to
language learners (fake conversations, textbook readings, etc). Try to aim for
young native material instead (children manga, etc).

For possible starting points, refer to
[[[Practical-Tips-to-Facilitate-Early-Reading]]] and [[e50a5ae3]].

### Consumption Phase

Once you have found what you want to consume, simply start reading.

I state *reading* here but there's multiple ways to consume native content. Do
not skip on listening too. There's all kinds of native sources, both passive and
active (as listed in the diagram). Do a little bit every day, don't think of it
as studying or a chore that you need to do, **simply just do stuff you enjoy but
do it in Japanese**. Consider giving [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkS5APqAFHA)
a watch to get an idea of what I mean.

In this step it is **fundamental** that you become aware that **Japanese is a
real language**. It's not just something you study in school and drill exercises
on. You need to make it a part of your life, and enjoy doing so.

### Improvement Phase

Whenever you find some word or grammar you do not understand, look it up using
the approaches explained in [[Unlocking-Japanese-Tricks]].

If you are using Bunpro, follow the advice in [[0c786881]] for grammar mining
as well. At this step, you are in the **Loop** for Bunpro too, so don't neglect
it.

As you see fit, add new words or sentences to your sentence mining deck,
and repeat. When you run out of material, go back to the **Discovery Phase**
and find something new to consume.

Once you start to feel more confident in your input, and you feel like you want
to challenge yourself in starting to output as well, take a look at the
[[[Learning-to-Output]]] page.

## Step 3: Fluency

Here be dragons. I can show you no path to get here. The only thing that can
get you here is yourself. Be consistent and keep doing at least a little every
day.  Language acquisition is **not a sprint, it is a marathon**.

Also remember that fluency means different things for different people and its
objective definition is not something you should be concerned about.

**Just loop**.
