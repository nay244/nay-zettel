# D205 - Data Acquisition

Data Acquisition builds proficiency in Structured Query Language (SQL) and the initial stages of the data analytics lifecycle. 
The course introduces relational databases. Students gain concrete skills in data transference and database manipulation.

## Course Analysis
D205 serves as basically an SQL refresher course. Upon starting, I realized I needed a refresher in SQL since my last encounter with it was during one of my database courses at George Mason, during my BSIT program. To brush up my skills, I opted for a course on DataCamp, a platform new to me. I was pleasantly surprised by their setup, which is quite similar to Udacity's, featuring browser-based plugins. One part of the screen provided instructions while the other allowed me to interact with a PostgreSQL database, run queries, and practice commands. The course content served mostly as a review, but I did pick up a few new concepts. I appreciated the hands-on approach to writing SQL queries, and the lessons were of good quality, logical, and functioned smoothly. However, I would have preferred more exercises that required independent problem-solving rather than semi-completed code snippets.

When it came to the project work, the core tasks were straightforward. I chose not to install pgAdmin/postgres on my personal computer, relying instead on the lab environment provided, which presented its own set of challenges. Although I was new to pgAdmin, I found it quite user-friendly. However, I was a bit disappointed that DataCamp didn't cover the pgAdmin GUI, and I wasn't keen on searching for external resources to learn it—something I find frustrating about online courses when the necessary materials aren't included. 

Completing the class took me about 4 days. To be transparent, I found the DataCamp lessons quite a slog—not because of the content, but the format just didn't sit well with me. Trying to complete numerous short lessons consecutively was incredibly tedious. Despite planning on dedicating a few hours each day, I only managed to cover a minimal amount of the course content. I often caught myself looking for distractions to avoid returning to the lessons—a rather inefficient way to spend my time.


## Final Thoughts

While the course did offer me a good refresher on SQL and navigating an online database through pgAdmin 4, I was not a huge fan of the virtual lab environment. Should I have the chance to redo the process, with my existing SQL knowledge, I would opt for joining a cohort to get a grasp of the requirements and then dive straight into the practical assignment. For those new to SQL, the DataCamp format might not be as challenging to navigate. It's possible that my prior experience was actually a hindrance, as I was seeking a review and decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, it seems it wasn't quite the right fit for me.
