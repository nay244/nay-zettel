# Python Cheatsheet

This page serves as a quick reference for python commands and basic explanations.

This entire section is based on [this page](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/doc/quick-ref.1.3.html)

## Invocation Options

python [-diuv] [-c command | script | - ] [args]
     -d   Turn on parser  debugging  output  (for  wizards  only,
          depending on compilation options).
     -i   When a script is passed as first  argument  or  the  -c
          option  is used, enter interactive mode after executing
          the script or  the  command.   It  does  not  read  the
          $PYTHONSTARTUP  file.   This  can  be useful to inspect
          global variables or a stack trace when a script  raises
          an exception.
     -s   Suppress auto-printing of expressions in interactive mode.
     -u   Force stdout and stderr to be totally unbuffered.
     -v   Print a message each  time  a  module  is  initialized,
          showing  the  place  (filename or built-in module) from
          which it is loaded.
     -c command
          Specify the command  to  execute  (see  next  section).
          This  terminates the option list (following options are
          passed as arguments to the command).
     -  anything afterward is passed as options to python script or
        command, not interpreted as an option to interpreter itself.
     
## Basic Types and Their Operations
  **Comparisions (defined between _any_ types)**
          <	strictly less than	
          <=	less than or equal	
          >	strictly greater than	
          >=	greater than or equal	
          ==	equal	
          !=	not equal  ( "<>" is also allowed)
          is	object identity	(are _objects_ identical, not values)
          is not	negated object identity
  **Numeric types**
  Floats, integers and long integers.
  **Operators on all numeric types**
  
          abs(x)	absolute value of x	
          int(x)	x converted to integer	
          long(x)	x converted to long integer	
          float(x)	x converted to floating point	
          -x	x negated	
          +x	x unchanged	
          x + y	sum of x and y	
          x - y	difference of x and y	
          x * y	product of x and y	
          x / y	quotient of x and y	
          x % y	remainder of x / y
          divmod(x, y)	the tuple (x/y, x%y)
          pow(x, y)	x to the power y	
  
  **Operators on all sequence types (lists, tuples, strings)**
  
  	len(s)		length of s	
  	min(s)		smallest item of s	
  	max(s)		largest item of s	
  	x in s		1 if an item of s is equal to x, else 0
  	x not in s	0 if an item of s is equal to x, else 1
  	s + t		the concatenation of s and t	
  	s * n, n * s	n copies of s concatenated	
  	s[i]		i'th item of s, origin 0
  	s[i:j]		slice of s from i to j	
   
## Function Definition
def <func_id> ([<param_list>]): <suite>
		-- creates a function object and assigns it name 
		   <func_id>.

## Class Definition
class <class_id> [(<super_class1> [,<super_class2>]*)]: 

## Built-In Function

abs(x)		Return the absolute value of a number

apply(f, args)
		Call func/method <f> with args <args>

callable(x)	Returns 1 if x callable, else 0.

chr(i)		Return one-character string whose ASCII code is
		integer i

cmp(x,y)	Return neg, zero, pos if x <, ==, > to y

coerce(x,y)	Return a tuple of the two numeric arguments converted to
	 	a common type.

compile(string, filename, kind) 
		Compile <string> into a code object.
		<filename> is used in error message, can be
		any string.  <kind> can be 'eval' if
		<string> is a single stmt, or 'single' which
		prints the output of expression statements that
		evaluate to something else than "None" or be 'exec'.

dir([object])	If no args, return the list of names in current local
		symbol table. With a module, class or class instance
		object as arg, return list of names in its attr dict.

divmod(a,b)	Returns tuple of (a/b, a%b)

eval(s, globals, locals)
		Eval string <s> in (optional) <globals>, <locals>. 
		<s> must have no NULL's or newlines. <s> can also be a
		code object.
		E.g.: x = 1; incr_x = eval('x + 1')

filter(function, list)
		Construct a list from those elements of <list> for which
	        <function> returns true. <function> takes one parameter.

float(x)	Convert a number to floating point.

getattr(object, name)
		Get attr called <name> from <object>.
		getattr(x, 'foobar') <=> x.foobar

globals()	Returns a dictionary containing current global variables.

hasattr(object, name)
		Returns true if <object> has attr called <name>.

hash(object)	Return the hash value of the object (if it has one)

hex(x)		Convert a number to a hexadecimal string.

id(object)	Return a unique 'identity' integer for an object.

input([prompt])	Prints prompt, if given. Reads input and evaluates it.

int(x)		Convert a number to a plain integer.

len(s)		Return the length (the number of items) of an object.

local()		Return a dictionary containing current local variables.

long(x)		Convert a number to a long integer.

map(function, list, ...)
		Apply <function> to every item of <list> and return a list
		of the results.  If additional arguments are passed, 
		<function> must take that many arguments and it is given
		to <function> on each call.

max(s)		Return the largest item of a non-empty sequence.

min(s)		Return the smallest item of a non-empty sequence.

oct(x)		Convert a number to an octal string.

open(filename [, mode='r', [bufsize=<implementation dependent>]])
		Return a new file object. First two args are same as 
		those for C's "stdio open" function. <bufsize> is 0
		for unbuffered, 1 for line-buffered, negative for
		sys-default, all else, of (about) given size.

ord(c)		Return integer ASCII value of <c> (str of len 1).

pow(x, y [, z])	Return x to power y [modulo z]

range(start [,end [, step]])
		return list of ints from >= start and < end. 
		With 1 arg, list from 0..<arg>-1
		With 2 args, list from <start>..<end>-1
		With 3 args, list from <start> up to <end> by <step>

raw_input([prompt])
		Print prompt if given, then read string from std
		input.

reduce(f, list [, init])
		Apply the binary function <f> to the items of
		<list> so as to reduce the list to a single value.
		If <init> given, it is "prepended" to <list>.

reload(module)	Re-parse and re-initialize an already imported module.
		Useful in interactive mode, if you want to reload a
		module after fixing it. If module was synactically
		correct but had an error in initialization, must
		import it one more time before calling reload().

repr(object)	Return a string containing a printable representation
		of an object. Equivalent to `object` (using
		backquotes).

round(x,n=0)	Return the floating point value x rounded to n digits
	 		after the decimal point.

setattr(object, name, value)
		This is the counterpart of getattr().
		setattr(o, 'foobar', 3) <=> o.foobar = 3

str(object)	Return a string containing a nicely printable
		representation of an object.

tuple(list)	Creates a tuple with same elements as <list>

type(object)	Return type of an object. E.g.,
		if type(x) == type(''): print 'It is a string'

vars([object])	Without arguments, return a dictionary corresponding
		to the current local symbol table.  With a module,
		class or class instance object as argument   
		returns a dictionary corresponding to the object's
		symbol table. Useful with "%" formatting operator.

xrange(start [, end [, step]])
		Like range(), but doesn't actually store entire list
		all at once. Good to use in "for" loops when there is a
		big range and little memory.
