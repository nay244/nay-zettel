# Migaku

[Migaku](https://www.patreon.com/Migaku) is the new project from Yoga.

Some of their toolings are still really solid and useful, the [[Anki]] card
exporter and mining system are probably one of my favorite to use.

I don't know about their pathreon itself, but it's definitely worth checking out
some of their tools. Most of them should be free too.
